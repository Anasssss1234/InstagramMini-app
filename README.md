# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  # InstagramMiniApp with React + vite
  Hello developers, my name is Anas Qureshi and today i am going to tell you about my small project that i have made on React,
  so, Firstly i have made a signUp page where you can create your account and when you fill your details ,those details
  will save in Local Storage . if you guys don't know about Local storage so i tell you, Local storage is nothing but like a database 
  where you can temporarily store all your data and later on, you can get those data and delete as well. Once you made your account then
  you will navigate to Login page. where you will have to fillup your email id and password that you have filled while making your 
  account if your details match with the details of your signup account details then, you will successfully loggedIn and navigate to the
  Insatalogo  route otherwise you will get the alert that your email id and password are wrong. for Routing, i have used a library which is 
  react-router-Dom . when you naviagte to the instaLogo you will get to see the logo of instagram and when you click on to that logo you 
  will redirect to the profile page before redirect to profile page you will see loading component for few seconds. once you go to the 
  profile page you will see there instagram profile Card you can delete the comment. you like the post, you can comment as well.
  that's all about this project i know this is very basic but i have made this project. totally i have focused on functionality.
